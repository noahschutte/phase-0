# Create a Playlist from Driver Code

# I worked on this challenge [with: Noah Schutte, Oscar Delgadillo].
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# Pseudocode
# Create a song class that accepts a song title and artist
  # Add ability to play song
    # LOOP a pause and print a hashtag a certain amount of times
  # Change the way a song is displayed normally to a nice formatted display
# Create a playlist class that accepts a list of songs
  # Add ability to add songs to existing playlists
  # Add ability to see the amount of songs in a playlist
  # Add ability to remove a song from an existing playlist
  # Add ability to check if a playlist includes a song
  # Add ability to play each song in the playlist
  # Add ability to display playlist information, nicely formatted

# Initial Solution
# class Song
#   def initialize(song_title, artist)
#     @song_title = song_title
#     @artist = artist
#   end
  
#   def play
#     puts @song_title
#     print "0:00 "
#     10.times do
#       sleep 0.1
#       print "#"
#     end
#     puts " 1:30"
#   end
  
#   def inspect
#     "#{@song_title} by #{@artist}"
#   end
    
# end

# class Playlist
#   def initialize(*songs)
#     @songs = songs
#   end
  
#   def add(*songs)
#     @songs.concat(songs)
#   end
  
#   def num_of_tracks
#     @songs.length
#   end
  
#   def remove(song)
#     if self.includes?(song)
#       @songs.delete(song)
#     end
#   end
  
#   def includes?(song)
#     @songs.include?(song)
#   end
  
#   def play_all
#     @songs.each do |song|
#       song.play
#     end
#   end
  
#   def display
#     puts "This playlist includes:"
#     @songs.each do |song|
#       puts "--#{song.inspect}--"
#     end
#   end
        
# end

# DRIVER CODE AND TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE

# Reflection
# What concepts did you review in this challenge?

# The creation of classes. 

# What is still confusing to you about Ruby?

# Learning some best practices for some topics, including refactoring. 

# What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?

# Practice more types of problems in Ruby.
