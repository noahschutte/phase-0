# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Articles I found interesting introduced the ideas of Flow, the Pomodoro technique, cereating new habits, Time Boxing, and starting success with small ideas.

Once concept I particularly likes was "Time Boxing." Time Boxing consists of setting a timer to complete a certain amount of work. Whether you finish or not, you reflect on what you were able to accomplish. This gives you an opportunity to take a break if need and helps you maintain focus on the task at hand.

Reflecting on my current habits, I manage my time very poorly. I allow myself to constantly switch between different tasks, keeping myself not accountable for the completion of one task before I move on. I believe this is one area that I need to strengthen through practice.

My current strategies are not working. I waste a lot of time due to a lack of focus.

I believe that the Pomodoro technique and time boxing my tasks will help me to isolate the work that I aim to accomplish and structure what outcomes I expect to achieve in a certain amount of time. The format for DBC easily allows for isolating challenges and time boxing allotments of work. 

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is a program that accepts text written as commands by the user and interprets the commands for the operating system to complete functions. A shell is referred to as a command-line interface, or CLI. There are many shell applications, including Powershell and Git Bash.

"Bash" is a command language and the most widely used Unix shell. 

I was surprised to find how relatively simple most of this command language was to understand and start executing. The most challenging part of the process was watching the introductory video on shell and feeling like I should already be understanding some of the complex commands that were being committed. But, I was put at ease when i started the written tutorial. 

There were a few commands that I was unsuccessful using, including "man", "apropos", and the extra commands provided. Instead, I found alternatives, like "--help".

The most important commands include: cs, ls, mkdir, mv, touch. If I could only learn one, it would be help. 

pwd: print working directory, ls: list all, mv: move, cd: change directory, ../: go up one folder, touch: create new file, mkdir: make directory, less: print file contents to page to thumb through, rmdir: remove directory, rm: remove file, help: displays command aspects.

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Creating a new repository on Github is as simple as: 1. Logging into Github, 2. Selecting New repository, 3. Naming and selecting repository settings, and 4. Clicking "Create repository."

Forking and cloning a repository from Github to your computer is a simple process that is easy to follow. 

1. Navigate to the repository that you want to clone from Github. You can access any public repository on Github, or private repositories that you have been invited to.

2. Click "Fork"

3. When asked where you would like to fork the repository, select your profile. The repository has now been forked onto your Github account.

4. Copy the <Clone HTML>

5. Open your command line and designate the path to where you would like to save the repository. 

6. enter: git clone <Clone HTML>

Congratulations! The repository has now been saved to your computer. 

 

Forking a repository is better than creating a new repository if you plan to work on the same materials that an existing project contains. Creating a fork does not affect the original project that you forked from, and any changes you make to the project you will own in your own account. It also saves the time of copying and pasting the content manually from the original project. 

 

I was initially intimidated by the all of the git programs that were added to my computer when I downloaded git. After completing these exercises, I realized I would not need to learn all new technologies. Instead, I would be using the same command line actions that I have been practicing this week. This week I was able to gain a proficiency and confidence in the command line that I thought would take weeks to obtain. I am very pleased with the shallow learning curve involved in understanding these foundation technologies.
