#### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Creating a repository is like setting up a bin in an office accross town. That bin merely contains a copy of your important documents. Every time you would like your records updated to reflect your home records, you mail a copy over to the remote repository, using a mailing address that the office provides you.

#### Describe what open source means.

Open source is the explicit intent that your work can be shared in any feasible way.

#### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I believe open source is a brilliant social design to iterate on eachother's best ideas. The world can collaborate without fear of persecution. If someone makes a change to a software product that no one likes, then people won't adopt it. If someone makes a change for the better, there is no restriction on the world adopting it and continuing to improve it. Software products are meant to add value in some way and make people's lives better. Open source speeds that process up to improve those possibilities.

#### Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licensing your products ensures that any iteration to your work is granted the same rights as you initially intended. If you want to profit from your product, you can. Likewise, if you don't care for profit, then no one should be able to profit from your work.

#### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I am becoming much more comfortable with the version control process once I've executed it about 5 times. Not only does it start to make rational sense, but I also develop process memory about what steps I need to execute to successfully merge to the master branch without jeapordizing any data.

#### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
