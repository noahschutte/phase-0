**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I think solidifying my understanding of some of the git workflow process will come naturally with more practice. Previously, I was confused by the order of steps that were required in order to maintain best practices and reduce the possibility of merge conflicts.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
It was productive to purposefully create a merge conflict and learn how to handle this process if it occured in the future. It made the issue less intimidating. 

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
Oscar, my pair, showed me a shortcut that allowed me to skip a step in the version control process. With git commit -a -m "message", I had to ask Oscar what the -a meant. He described that I could skip the add step and instead type -a in the commit command.

**What still confuses you about git?**
In a working team, who should be responsible for deleting a branch from Github?

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
Very positive. My pair was both knowledgeable and helpful. I was able to practice new skills and communicate effectively what we were both accomplishing.
