**How do you define a local variable?**

A local variable does not have an inherent value until it is called and assigned. Local variables should start with a lowercase letter, include letters, numbers, and either hyphens or underscores. A local variable can only be called within it's scope. In some cases that may be within the file, or even within a single method. 
	
**How do you define a method?**

If a string, number, float, or variable is a noun in the English language, then a method is a verb. It is an action that an object takes or an action that is taken on the object. Methods "do things", whereas nouns simply refer to a value or string. 

**What is the difference between a local variable and a method?**

Akin to my example above, a local variable is a value or string that acts like a noun. Methods are actions that either happen to nouns or that nouns enact. 

**How do you run a ruby program from the command line?**

In my VM, I am running linux. On linux, I navigate to the local repository that holds the files that I want to run. For spec files, I run rspec and the file name. For ruby files, I run ruby and the ruby file name. I am also able to run irb for the interactive ruby shell scripting. For this I must "exit" out when I'm done shell scripting. 

**What was confusing about this material? What made sense?**

The most confusing aspect was understanding the syntax of ruby. The tasks were straightforward, but the detail required for successfully running a test set me back the most time.
