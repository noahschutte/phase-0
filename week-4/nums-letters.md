**What does puts do?**

Puts will print the output to the console on a new line. P will also print the output to the console on a new line, but will also return nil. Up until now, I am not able to see a useful difference bwtween these two. Alternatively, print will print the output to the console, but will not enter a line break, so any additional print on the console will following directly after on the same line.

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

An integer is any whole number. A float is a number that has a decimal somewhere in it. 

| **Hours in a year?** | **Minutes in a decade?** |
| :--- | ---: |
| Hours * Days | Minutes * Hours * Days * Years |
| 24 * 365.25 | 60 * 60 * 365.25 * 10 |
| 8766 | 13149000 |

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

When dividing integer, the system will only return whole integers. The quotient will always be rounded down, because the remainder will be ignored. 

Float division will return a float, or a value with a decimal in it. 

The reason is that programming aims to deal in whole numbers. The elements of a software product, like number of emails or number of views are counted in whole numbers. There is no such thing as half of an email or viewers.

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

The mathematics of Ruby behave the same way as any 10 key calculator with ( + , - , / , * ). Solutions are returned from any of these calculations. 

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

Strings are unique from integers and floats. Strings can be empty or include numbers, letters, spaces, and special characters. Variables are often pointed to strings. 

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

Local variables are variables assigned within a file. Local variables cannot be called outside the file they are assigned. 

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**

The exercises assigned have been very easy so far. I am grateful of this, because the difficult part has been understanding how to work on the text editor, the command line, the VM running ruby, and reading the assignment while researching.
