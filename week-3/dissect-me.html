    <h2>Our Shared Blog</h2>
      <p>
        For my first blog post, I will talk about the benefits of using version control programs, and why git and GitHub is important to master for oncoming developers. For Dev Bootcamp, we use a program called "git" that takes on the likeness of a standard command line or Terminal that accompany most computer operating systems. The program git, as a version control software, is able to create, edit save the progress of a working project both locally and remote through its ability to push the changes to a cloud system. i would recommend anyone trying to learn git to check out both http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ and http://gitref.org/basic/. Those are two great sources for both understanding how to navigate the command line effectively as well as understanding git commands quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
         Git, as version control software, has a powerful tool called the "commit". The commit is a command that saves the project as a snapshot/(current version ) of all the changes made thus far by a user. With a commit, you can access those various save points of a project in order to fix broken code, or revert back to an original state if a user decides too. This is important because as you work with git, you can make a comment on the commit on the changes made to your project for both future reference for you, and any other developer who decides to review your work. Not only will they have a save point to access the code at that particular state, they can also read the comment made on the changes you made to better understand the thought process behind it.      </p>
      <p>
         In regards to having other developers review your code for clarity; Github.com is the perfect place to store your code for collaboration projects because of its ability to have code be pushed to it via the version control program git. GitHub is a type social networking place where developers can REMOTELY work on code without needing to have a master of the source code be stored locally on their computer. With GitHub, you can have developers edit a copy of their master code without disrupting other team members from downloading a stable version of the master code for themselves. This is important, because once and individual pushes code to the source as master, everyone who then pulls down that master for their own use, will have that version of it. This idea of sharing and letting others work with code that can be easily distributed, is great for people who are looking to expand the project to others with father reach. If a project is properly license and is written with Open Source in mind, many additions can be added quickly, from all over the world. People could volunteer to work on a part of the code, that you would not have normally been able to reach to if your source code was not pushed to GitHub, and your project was stored locally or on a local server.

      <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
      <p>
        Without version control, applications would take years to build. A single developer would have to oversee every feature implementation. Two people could never work on the same project at the same time. New York could build another skyscraper by the time twitter could announce the building's opening. 
      </p>
      <h3>How does the git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
      <p>
        Version control is a process that developers in a team all agree to using. It assures developers that if they borrow a bundle of code to work on all day, their work will fit neatly back in place when they've completed that work. In the meanwhile, other developers are able to work on other portions of code and not step on eachother's toes.  
      </p>
      <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
      <p>
        GitHub is an excellent place to store a project's code, because it is remotely accessible, where many developers can view and access the code at any time. If all code was stored locally, a developer may have to meet you in person to access the most recently updated version of the software. And visit again each and every time they have made any changes to the code.
