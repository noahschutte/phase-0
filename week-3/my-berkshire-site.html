<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I felt powerful. It was awesome to remember what tags I recently learned about and was able to manipulate into the berkshire site. I was faced with very small issues, one aspect at a time and was able to quickly identify and resolve each of them. 

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I thought it was clear and simple to research simple issues, one at a time. I first attempted to copy and paste a trademark symbol into my html file, but found that it was not being printed as anticipated. So, I googled "copywrite symbol html" and I was quickly able to identify that there was a unique character entity for the symbol I was trying to use. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
This assignment required very little formatting. I only changed the header from h1 to h4, found a vertical line that can be entered as <hr> and I changed the size of an inline image using height and width tags.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems like an easy to use and structured language to display content with ease. On the other hand, the structure can be rigid when attempting to make text more interesting than reading a disctionary. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Keep a cheatsheet handy. ;)
