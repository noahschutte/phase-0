**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**

You can add, remove, or edit css attributes to different objects. 

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**

By changing the margin, border, and padding.

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning?**

static - elements render in order, as they appear in document flow
absolute - element is positioned relative to its first positioned ancestor element
fixed - element is positioned relative to the browser window
relative - element is positioned relative to its normal position
initial - sets this property to its default value
inherit - inherits this property from its parent element

**Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**

We ended up using fixed or relative, without much regard to the other property values

**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**

Content - the contents of the box
Padding - clears an area aroung the content
Border - goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border

**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**

It was frustrating overall, but it's clear that it is a necessary exercise to start to understand the different aspects of styling html content.
