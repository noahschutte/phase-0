// Eloquent JavaScript

// Run this file in your terminal using `node my_solution.js`. Make sure it works before moving on!

// Program Structure
// Write your own variable and do something to it.

var age = 27;

age = 28;

console.log(age);

// Complete one of the exercises: Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, or Chess Board



// Functions

// Complete the `minimum` exercise.



// Data Structures: Objects and Arrays
// Create an object called "me" that stores your name, age, 3 favorite foods, and a quirk below.

var me = newObject() {
	name: "Noah",
	age: 27,
	fav_foods: [sandwiches, smoothies, coffee],
	quirk: "hugger"

// Introduction (Links to an external site.)
// Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
// Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?

// Ch. 1: Values, Types, and Operators (Links to an external site.)
// Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.

// Ch. 2: Program Structure (Links to an external site.)
// What is an expression?
// What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?
// What causes a variable to return undefined?
// Write your own variable and do something to it in the eloquent.js file.
// What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby method(s) is this similar to?
// Write a short program that asks for a user to input their favorite food. After they hit return, have the program respond with "Hey! That's my favorite too!" (You will probably need to run this in the Chrome console (Links to an external site.) rather than node since node does not support prompt or alert). Paste your program into the eloquent.js file.
// Describe while and for loops
// What other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript did you notice in this section?
// Complete at least one of the exercises (Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, of Chess Board) in the eloquent.js file.

// Ch. 3: Functions (Links to an external site.) (Skip the sections on closure and recursion)
// What are the differences between local and global variables in JavaScript?
// When should you use functions?
// What is a function declaration?
// Complete the minimum exercise in the eloquent.js file.

// Ch. 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays (Links to an external site.) 
// Skip the sections on the Lycanthrope's log, Computing Correlations, and sections from Further Arrayology to the Global Object, but read the chapter summary.
// What is the difference between using a dot and a bracket to look up a property? Ex. array.max vs array["max"]
// Create an object called me that stores your name, age, three favorite foods, and a quirk in your eloquent.js file.
// What is a JavaScript object with a name and value property similar to in Ruby?

// Reflection

// What are the biggest similarities and differences between JavaScript and Ruby?

// Was some of your Ruby knowledge solidified by learning another language? If so, which concepts?
